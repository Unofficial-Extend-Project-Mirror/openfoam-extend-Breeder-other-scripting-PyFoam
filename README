What it is
==========

The purpose of this library is to support working with the OpenSource
CFD-toolbox OpenFOAM_ and its forks

This Python_ library can be used to

* analyze the logs produced by OpenFoam-solvers
* execute OpenFoam-solvers and utilities and analyze their output
  simultaneously
* manipulate the parameter files and the initial-conditions of a run
  in a non-destructive manner
* plots the residuals of OpenFOAM solvers
* lots of other stuff

Most of this functionality is made available to the user in the form
of command-line utilities.

PyFoam does all this strictly "from the outside": by writing parameter
files and reading the output of the solvers. Without compiled parts or
being linked to OpenFOAM.

More information is found on `the OpenFOAM Wiki`_
