What it is
==========

This Python (http://www.python.org)-library can be used to

    * analyze the logs produced by OpenFoam-solvers
    * execute OpenFoam-solvers and utilities and analyze their output simultaneously
    * manipulate the parameter files and the initial-conditions of a run in a non-destructive manner
    * plots the residuals of OpenFOAM solvers
