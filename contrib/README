This directory contains useful stuff that was provided by other users.
The reason why it is not fully integrated into the distribution is,
that I don't have the time and/or a similar setup to fully test it.

Olesen_centralInstallation
--------------------------

A set of scripts that support using the pyFoam-Scripts on multiple
from a central installation.

The profile.pyfoam goes into the /etc/profile.d of the machines that
use it. The pyFoam-Script goes into the a directory on the involved
machines and the makelinks-pyFoam-script creates dynamic links to that
script (which will call the corresponding script from the cental
installation). This has to be done once by the root. After that a
non-root user can maintain the central installation (provided he has
write access to that)

The paths in the files have to be adapted to your site.

Mercurial_extension
-------------------

An extension to the Version-control system Mercurial that adds a
command foamdiff to hg. This command shows the difference between
revisions in a file. The differences are shown as differences between
OpenFOAM-dictionaries (the way the utility pyFoamCompareDictionary.py
does) not as the textual differences. The extension is installed the
way extensions are usually installed in mercurial. In the file ~/.hgrc
add the path to the extension in the extension-section:

[extensions]
foamdiff = <Path to the PyFoam-Installation>/PyFoam/contrib/Mercurial_extension/foamdiff.py
