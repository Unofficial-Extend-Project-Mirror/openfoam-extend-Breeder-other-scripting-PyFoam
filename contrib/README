The reason why it is not fully integrated into the distribution is,
that I don't have the time and/or a similar setup to fully test it.

Olesen_centralInstallation
--------------------------

A set of scripts that support using the pyFoam-Scripts on multiple
from a central installation.

The profile.pyfoam goes into the /etc/profile.d of the machines that
use it. The pyFoam-Script goes into the a directory on the involved
machines and the makelinks-pyFoam-script creates dynamic links to that
script (which will call the corresponding script from the cental
installation). This has to be done once by the root. After that a
non-root user can maintain the central installation (provided he has
write access to that)

The paths in the files have to be adapted to your site.
