"""gp_unix -- an interface to gnuplot used for unix platforms.

This file implements a low-level interface to a gnuplot program for a
unix platform (actually it is used for any non-Windows, non-Mac
system).  This file should be imported through gp.py, which in turn
should be imported via 'import Gnuplot' rather than these low-level
interfaces.

    Store the options in a class to make them easy to import and
    modify en masse.  If you want to modify the options from the
    command line or within a running program, do something like the
    following::

        import Gnuplot
        Gnuplot.GnuplotOpts.gnuplot_command = '/bin/mygnuplot'

    """

    # Command to start up the gnuplot program.  If your version of
    # gnuplot is run otherwise, specify the correct command here.  You
    # could also specify a full path or append command-line options
    # here if you wish.
    gnuplot_command = 'gnuplot'

    # Recent versions of gnuplot (at least for Xwindows) allow a
    # `-persist' command-line option when starting up gnuplot.  When
    # this option is specified, graph windows remain on the screen
    # even after you quit gnuplot (type `q' in the window to close
    # it).  This can be handy but unfortunately it is not supported by
    # older versions of gnuplot.  The following configuration variable
    # specifies whether the user's version of gnuplot recognizes this
    # option or not.  You can set this variable to 1 (supports
    # -persist) or 0 (doesn't support) yourself; if you leave it with
    # the value None then the first time you create a Gnuplot object
    # it will try to detect automatically whether your version accepts
    # this option.

    # specified explicitly?

    # option to the splot command for grid data, which means that the
    # data file is to be read in binary format.  This option saves
    # substantial time writing and reading the file, and can also save
    # substantial disk space and therefore it is the default for that
    # type of plot.  But if you have an older version of gnuplot (or
    # you prefer text format) you can disable the binary option in
    # either of two ways: (a) set the following variable to 0; or (b)
    # pass `binary=0' to the GridData constructor.  (Note that the
    # demo uses binary=0 to maximize portability.)
