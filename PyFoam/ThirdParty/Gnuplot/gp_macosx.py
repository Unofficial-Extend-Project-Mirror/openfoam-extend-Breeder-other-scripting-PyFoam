"""gp_macosx -- an interface to the command line version of gnuplot
used under Mac OS X.

The only difference between this interface and gp_unix is that
default_term is 'aqua'.

This file implements a low-level interface to gnuplot.  This file
should be imported through gp.py, which in turn should be imported via
'import Gnuplot' rather than using these low-level interfaces
directly.
