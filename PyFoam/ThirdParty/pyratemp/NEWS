0.2.0 (2010-06-15)
  Update notice from 0.1.x:
    no changes to your templates should be necessary,
    and you only need to modify your Python-code if you have used
    the classes StringLoader, FileLoader, PseudoSandbox, TemplateEval
    or TemplateBase directly.

  - added functionality:
    - variables can now be set in the template ("EvalPseudoSandbox.f_setvar()")
    - "dummy-import" ("EvalPseudoSandbox.f_import()")
    - modularized for better extensibility

  - Python-code syntax changes:
    - renamed class StringLoader to LoaderString
    - renamed class FileLoader to LoaderFile
    - unified PseudoSandbox + TemplateEval in EvalPseudoSandbox
    - changed parameter-order of TemplateBase

  - template-syntax minor improvements:
    - check that macro-names are \w+
    - comments (#!...) are now allowed after multi-line-block-tags

  - fixed a minor bug which caused that a function registered in one
    eval-sandbox-instance was available in all instances

  - review, documentation, cleanup

0.1.5 (2009-01-20)
  - fixed a bug (in the parser) which caused that "#!" at the end-of-line
    directly before a single-line-block at the beginning of the next line
    did not remove the newline
    (single-line-blocks now only consume [ \t] instead of \s as P<sSpace>)

0.1.4 (2008-12-21)
  - fixed a bug (in the parser) which caused that substitutions/blocks at the
    beginning of a template after some whitespace raised an exception

0.1.3 (2008-12-20)
  - fixed a bug (in the parser) which caused that empty macros raised an
    exception

0.1.2 (2008-12-19)
  - fixed a problem which caused that single-line-blocks did not work
    after some spaces at the beginning of a line
  - documentation update
  - removed template.txt/template.html from release
  - files renamed according to the "Software Release Practice HOWTO"

0.1 (2008-12-14)
  - initial release
