* Version 0.6.1 - 2013-05-24
** Major changes
** Bugfixes
*** Restoring of =controlDict= after =write=
    When activating an on-demand write the =constrolDict= was not
    restored because the output-line about the file being read was not
    recognized (due to a change in the output in recent
    OF-versions). Now a number of different formats is recognized
*** Custom-plot type =slave= not working if no =master= defined
    That plot-type needs a =master=. Fixed to fail if none is defined
*** =-list-only= did not correctly parse lists with a numeric prefix
    This did affect all utilities that use that option and also calls
    with =listOnly= to the library class
** Utilities
*** =pyFoamBuildHelper.py= now allow more than one action
    If multiple actions like =--update= and =--build= are specified
    they are executed in a sensible order (update before build etc)
*** Utilities warn if OpenFOAM-version is unset
    If the environment variable that determines the OpenFOAM-version
    is unset a warning is issued by the utilities
*** =pyFoamUpgradeDictionariesTo20.py= allows single files
    If  single file is specified then the action to transform it has
    can be specified
*** =pyFoamUpgradeDictionariesTo20.py= transforms reaction-schemes
    Now knows how to transform "old" reaction files (where the
    =reactions=-entry was a list) to the new format (where it is a
    dictionary). Only a limited number of reaction types is supported.
*** =pyFoamUpgradeDictionariesTo20.py= transforms thermophysical data
    Now the old form of thermophysical data (lists) is transformed
    into the new dictionary-form
*** =pyFoamCloneCase= now allows creating directory that symlinks to the original
    Now with the option =--symlink-mode= instead of copying the
    directories from the original new directories art created and
    populated with symlinks to the files in the original. The depth
    until which no symlinks to directories are created can be
    specified. This allows the clone to share the configuration files
    with the original
*** =pyFoamClearCase.py= now removes =postProcessing= and allows removal of additional files
    The directory =postProcessing= is now automatically removed (can be
    switched off with =--keep-postprocessing=). Also with the
    =--additional=-option patterns with additional files to remove
    can be specified.
*** Improvements to =pyFoamVersion.py=
    - Now reports the location of the =python=-executable
    - Reports locations of used libraries
*** Additional files automatically cloned
    The files =Allrun=, =Allclean= and =0.org= are automatically
    added during cloning as these are often used by the standard-utilities
*** =pyFoamDisplayBlockMesh.py= uses the same options for template format as =pyFoamFromTemplate.py=
    This makes sure that templates are handled consistently and also
    allows different delimiters in the =blockMeshDict.template=
** Library
*** Improvements in syntax of =ParsedParameterFile=
    - Now the new relative scoping that was introduced in OF 2.2 is
      supported
*** =Utilities=-class now function to find files matching a pattern
    Added a function =find= that approxiamtes the =find=-command
*** VCS ignores more files
    Some more patterns have been added that will be ignored in a
    VSC-controlled case. All of them concerning files that PyFoam
    creates during operation
** New features/Utilities
*** New Utility =pyFoamSymlinkToFile.py=
    This utility replaces a symlink with a copy of the
    file/directories it points to. To be used after a
    =pyFoamCloneCase.py= in =--symlink-mode=
* Version 0.6.0 - 2013-03-14
** Major changes
*** Adaption to work with Python3
    Sources are adapted so that =PyFoam= works with Python3 too. This
    breaks support for Python 2.4 and earlier (possibly also Python
    2.5)

    Some of the Libraries in =PyFoam.ThirdParty= had to be adapted to
    work with Python3:
    - Gnuplot.py :: The original version 1.8 is quite old. It was
                    adapted with the help of the =six=-library (see
                    below) to work with Python2 and Python3 (inspired
                    by
                    [https://github.com/oblalex/gnuplot.py-py3k/commits/master]
                    which is a pure port to Python3 without backwards
                    compatibility)
*** New ThirdParty-Libraries
    - six :: Library that helps supporting Python 2 and Python 3 in
             the same source code. Currently version 1.2 from
             [https://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six] is used
    - pyratemp :: Templating library to support the new templating
                  format. Version 0.2.0 from
                  [http://www.simple-is-better.org/template/pyratemp.html]
                  is used
*** Porting to =Windows=
    Port to allow running PyFoam on Windows was done by Bruno Santos
    of blueCAPE (bruno.santos@bluecape.com.pt)

    Patch was originally posted at
    http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=166

    *Note*: many of PyFoam's features are not yet fully functional on
    Windows.
*** Experimental port to =pypy=
    Sources are executed in =pypy= but it seems there are problems
    with =numpy= and also with code like =for l in open(f).readlines()=
** Third-Party
*** Upgraded =ply= to 3.4
    This brings virtually no changes. =README= with copyright
    information has been added
** Infrastructure
*** Parameters can't be modified in =CTestRun= after initialization
    This should help to avoid side-effects
*** Treat timeouts in the =MetaServer= right
    Due to a previous workaround timeouts when collecting information
    about new machines was not treated correctly
*** Add =execute=-method to =ClusterJob=
    This allows the execution of a shell-script in the directory of
    the case
*** Add possibility to run specific modules before or after the solver
    These modules are found in =PyFoam.Infrastructure.RunHooks=. Two
    concrete implementations:
    - =PrintMessageHook= :: to print a text to the terminal
    - =SendToWebservice= :: encode an URL and send it to a webservice
         (example for =pushover.net= added)
    Hooks are automatically instantiated from the configuration data
    (examples are hardcoded))
*** Parameters added to the info about the run
    The Runner-classes now have a parameter =parameters=. This data
    (usually it would be a dictionary) is added verbatim to the run
    info.

    Most runner applications now have the possibility to add this
    info.

    Purpose of this facility is to identify different runs in the
    database better.
*** Parameter handling in =ClusterJob= extended
    Parameter values are now handed to the actual job. Also a
    dictionary with parameters can be handed to the constructor and
    will be used in the relevant callbacks
*** Run data written alongside =PickledPlots=
    During the run whenever the =PickledPlots=-file is written a file
    =pickledUnfinishedData= gets written. This has the current solver
    data and is similar to =pickledData=.

    Also a file =pickledStartData= gets written that has the data that
    is available at the start of the run.
*** =BasicRunner= collects error and warning texts
    The runner collects
    - at every warning the next 20 lines of the output until a total
      of 500 lines is reached (this avoids filling disk and memory if
      the solver produces too many warnings)
    - All output from an error message until the end
    And stores them in the application data
** Library
*** =TemplateFile= now uses =pyratemp=
    The class =TempalteFile= now uses an enhanced templating
    engine. The  old implementation is in the class
    =TemplateFileOldFormat=
*** Clearer error message in Application-classes
    If used as classes (not as utilities) these classes print the
    class name instead of the calling utilities name
*** Output is only colored if it goes to the terminal
    Error and warning messages don't decorate the output if it goes to
    files or other non-terminal streams
*** =error=-method of application classes now raises an exception
    An exception is now raised by =self.error()=. This makes it easier
    to handle such errors if the application class is used. The
    exception is passed up until there is a "real" application
*** =ParsedParameterFile= now knows how to handle binary files
    When the format of a file is =binary= lists with a length prefix
    are being read as binary blobs.

    For reading the blobs a simple heuristics is used: a multiple of
    the length in bytes is read. If the next character is a =)= and
    the characters after that are a certain combination of characters
    (newlines and =;=) then it is assumed that the blob has
    ended. This may fail on certain occasions:
    - if the combination of characters appears at these places
    - if the objects inside the binary data are of different sizes
    It would be hard to work around these restrictions without
    reprogramming the full functionality of OpenFOAM
*** =LabledReSTTable= for more flexible table generation
    New class in the =RestructuredTextHelper= allows more flexible
    generation of tables. Items are added with =column= and =row= and
    if these don't exist in the first row/column the table is extended
    appropriately
*** Plotting classes now allow setting of =xlabel=
    This is implemented for =Gnuplot= and =Matplotlib=. Default for
    the label on the x-Axis is now "Time [s]"
** Utilities
*** =pyFoamFromTemplate.py= with new templating engine
    The utility can now use the pyratemp-templating engine which
    allows templates with loops, conditions and other  fancy stuff
*** =pyFoamSamplePlot.py= allows using the reference data as basis for comparison
    Instead of using the x-values from the original data the y-values
    of the reference data can be used for comparing (with the
    =--use-reference=-option)

    Same for =pyFoamTimelimePlot.py=
*** Scaling and offsets are now used in plots of =pyFoamSamplePlot.py=
    If scales not equal to $1$ and offsets not equal to $0$ are
    specified they are used in the =gnuplot=-output
*** =pyFoamPrintData2DStatistics.py= prints relative average error
    With the =--relative-average-error=-option
*** Enhancements to =pyFoamVersion.py=
    - More tolerant if no library was found
    - Reports the location of the PyFoam-Library
    - Checks whether utility version is consistent the library found
*** =pyFoamRunner.py= allows hooks
    Hooks can be added at the start and the end of a run
*** =pyFoamRedoPlots.py= supports range for plots
    Added =-end= and =-start=-option to select a range that should be
    plotted.

    Currently not working with the Matplotlib-implementation (only gnuplot)
*** =pyFoamDisplayBlockMesh.py= no supports templates
    If a file with values is specified then the utility assumes you're
    editing a template file and will evaluate it before displaying it
*** =pyFoamCaseReport.py= is tolerant towards binary files
    New switch that makes the parser treat files that are declared
    =binary= in the header as if they were =ascii=
*** =pyFoamSamplePlot.py= and =pyFoamTimelinePlot.py= raise error if no plots are generated
    This makes it easier to catch faulty specifications (or empty
    timeline-files)
*** =pyFoamSurfacePlot.py= can wait for a key
    An option =--wait= has been added that makes the utility wait
    before displaying the next picture
*** =pyFoamEchoDictionary.py= is more flexible with binary files
    Switch allows forcing it to read a binary File as an ASCII
*** All utilities now have a switch that starts the debugger even with syntax-errors
    Previously the option =--interactive-debug= only started the
    debugger if the error was *no* syntax error. This is still the
    default behavior, but can be overruled
*** Utilities now can be killed with =USR1= and will give a traceback
    The option =--catch-USR1-signal= now installs a signal-handler
    that prints a traceback and finishes the run. If the interactive
    debugger is enabled then it goes to the debugger-shell.

    Option =--keyboard-interrupt-trace= triggers the same behaviour
    for keyboard interrupts with =<Ctrl>-C=
*** Switch to switch on *all* debug options
    For the purpose of developing a switch =--i-am-a-developer= has
    been added.
*** Plotting utilities now allow specification of x-Axis label
    With the option =xlabel= in the =customRegexp=-file the label on
    the x-axis of the plot can be changed. Setting =ylabel= and
    =y2label= (for the secondary axis) was already possible
*** Metrics and compare for =pyFoamTimelinePlot.py= and =pyFoamSamplePlot.py= support time ranges
    Now the options =--min-time= and =--max-time= are supported by
    =--metrics= and =--compare=
*** =pyFoamDisplayBlockMesh.py= allows graphical selection of blocks and patches
    New addition by Marc Immer allows the graphical selection of
    blocks and patches and adds them to the =blockMeshDict=
*** =pyFoamCloneCase.py= and =pyFoamPackCase.py= accept additional parameters
    The file =LocalConfigPyFoam= is read by these utilities and if
    there is a parameter =addItem= in the section =Cloning= defined
    then these files are cloned/packed automatically (no user
    specification required)
*** =pyFoamListCases.py= now calculates estimated end-times
    Additional option to print the estimated end times. These can be
    wrong if the case did not start from the =startTime= in the
    =controlDict=.

    Also now allows printing the end and the start-time according to
    the =controlDict=
** New features
*** Different "phases" for multi-region solvers
    Plots of type =phase= in =customRegexp= don't actually plot
    anything. The set a phase-name that is used for subsequent values
    (for instance to distinguish the different residuals)
*** =pyFoamChangeBoundaryType.py= allows selection of region and time
    Options =--region= and =--time-directory= added that allow
    selecting different =boundary=-files
*** New class for storing case data in a sqlite-database and associated utilities
    The class =RunDatabase= stores the data from runs. Utility
    =pyFoamAddCaseDataToDatabase.py= is one way to populate the
    database. =pyFoamDumpRunDatabaseToCSV.py= allows dumping that
    data to a file for further processing (in a spreadsheet for
    instance)

    Database can also be populated using a special post-run hook
** Bugfixes
*** Only binary packages of 1.x were found
    Pattern had to start with 1 (now every digit is possible))
*** Option group /Regular expressions/ was listed twice
    No harm done. But fixed
*** =--clear=-option for =pyFoamDecompose.py= not working
    Reason was that =rmtree= does not allow wildcards. Fixed
*** =pyFoamDisplayBlockmesh.py= not working with variable substitution
    The =DictRedirect= would not convert to float. Fixed. Although it
    might happen again for other data types
*** Option =--function-object-data= of =pyFoamClearCase.py= not working with directories
    The option was only implemented for the list-form of the
    =functions= entry in =controlDict=

    Now fixed to also work with the dictionary-form
*** =nonuniform= of length 0 not correctly printed
    Seems like the length was interpreted as the name of the
    list. Fixed
*** Building of pseudocases with =pyFoamRunner.py= broken
    Only worked if no region was specified (= not at all). Fixed
*** =pyFoamRedoPlot.py= did not correctly honor =--end= and =--start=
    Plots were over the whole data range. This is now fix (also the
    issue that =--end= alone did not work)
*** =WriteParameterFile= does not preserve the order of additions
    Contents was "only" set as a dictionary which does not preserve
    the order in which entries are added. Replaced with a =DictProxy=
*** Wrong number of arguments when using =TimelinePlot= in =positions=-mode
    Problem that was introduced by changes in the =fields=-mode
*** =ClusterJob= uses only =metis= for decomposition
    For OpenFOAM-versions 1.6 and higher the automatic decomposition
    used is now =scotch=
*** =pyFoamSamplePlot.py= and =pyFoamTimelinePlot.py= produced no pictures for regions
    As regions have their own subdirectories the =/= from the
    directory name was inserted into the filename and if the
    subdirectory did not exist =gnuplot= did not create the picture
*** Barplots in =pyFoamTimelinePlot.py= not working if value is a vector
    The base class didn't correctly handle the =(= and =)=. Fixed
*** Mysterious deadlocks while plotting long logfiles
    The problem was that during splitting the timeline data an exception was
    raised. This exception was caught by another part of PyFoam. This
    left a lock on the data structure locked and the next access to
    the structure was held indefinitely. Fixed
*** Scanning linear expressions form the block coupled solver failed
    As there is a tuple of residuals the scanner did not analyze the
    output of the output of the block-coupled solver from =1.6-ext=
    correctly. This is now treated as a special case and each residual
    is plotted separately (distinguished by a =[x]= with =x= being the
    number of the component)
*** =#include= not correctly working with macros in the included file
    Macros =$var= were not correctly expanded. Fixed
*** Macros not correctly expanded to strings
    When being expanded to string form macros were not correctly
    expanded
*** =pyFoamPackCase.py= in the working directory produces 'invisible' tar
    If the utility was used in the form
: pyFoamPackCase.py .
    then an 'invisible' tar =..tgz= was produced. Fixed
*** String at the end of a linear solver output makes parsing fail
    Reported in
    [http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-solving/112278-pyfoam-struggles-adopted-solver-post403990.html]
    the string is assumed to be part of the iteration number. Fixed
*** Paraview utilities not working with higher Paraview versions
    At least for PV 3.14 and 3.98 the way the version number is
    determined has changed and the PV-utilities failed. This has been
    fixed but is untested with old versions
*** Camera settings not honored with =pyFoamPVSnapshot.py=
    For the first rendered view Paraview automatically resets the
    camera. This has now been switched off (so the snapshot is
    rendered correctly)
