* Version 0.6.6 - 2016-07-15
** Incompatibilities
*** Changes in =IPython=-notebooks 3.0
    With IPython 3.0 the names of the Widget classes lost the =Widget=
    in the name (for instance =DropdownWidget= becomes
    =Dropdown=). =PyFoam= has been changed to conform with this but as
    a consequence won't work with old version of the =IPython=
    notebooks
** Enhancements to Utilities
*** =pyFoamPrepareCase.py= executes =setFields= if appropriate
    If no setup-script is specified and if there is a =setFieldsDict=
    present then =setFields= is automatically executed
*** Plotting utilities now automatically add custom plots depending on the solver name
    The configuration system now has a section =Autoplots=. The
    entries there are all dictionaries with two entries:
    - solvers :: a list of regular expressions. If the name of the
                 currently used solver matches any of these
                 expressions then this entry is used
    - plotinfo :: a dictionary with the plot information known from
                  regular =customRegexp=: =expr=, =titles= etc
    If the solver matches =solvers= then a custom plot based on
    =plotinfo= is automatically added.

    If the solver does not fit the plot is *not* added (this helps
    avoid processing of unused =expr=. This is important because
    processing the =expr= is one of the things =PyFoam= uses the most
    computation time for)

    Some common plots (phase fractions for instance or most of the
    output of =chtMultiRegionFoam=) are hardcoded into =PyFoam=

    Also there is a new section =[SolverBase]= in the
    configuration. It is checked whether the current solver name
    *begins* with any of the keys there. If it does then the list of
    solvers is assumed to be the solvers this solver was based on and
    =Autoplots= for those solvers are added as well. For instance
: [SolverBase]
: myReactingCht: ["chtMultiRegionFoam","reactingFoam"]
    assumes that a solver =myReactingChtFoam= is based on these two
    solvers and automatically adds their =Autoplots=

    In addition if a setting like
: [Plotting]
: autoplots: cloudNumberMass
    is set (for instance through =LocalConfigPyFoam= in the case) then
    the autoplot =cloudnumbermass= is used regardless of the solver
    name
*** =alternateAxis=-entries now can be regular expressions
    This allows specifying plots generated with =type dynamic= on the
    alternate axis
*** Plotting utilities now allow choice of Gnuplot terminal
    These utilities now allow with the option =--gnuplot-terminal= to
    choose the terminal. Otherwise the terminal specified in the
    configuration (usually =x11=) is used
*** Plotting utilities now sort legend by name
    Names in the legend are now sorted. This improves readability for
    large numbers of lines in the plot
*** =pyFoamExecute.py= allows calling with debugger
    The option =--run-with-debugger= runs the command in the
    debugger. The arguments are appropriately handled
*** =pyFoamPrepareCase.py= fails if execution of a script fails
    If the execution of a script fails (the status code returned by
    the script is not $0$) then execution of the utility fails (before
    the utility just continued). This behavior can be overridden with
    the option =--continue-on-script-failure=.

    It is up to the script to ensure that the failure of a utility
    called in the script is forwarded to =pyFoamPrepareCase.py=. For
    instance with
: set -e
    in a =bash=-script
*** =--hardcopy= in plotting library now allows modification of =gnuplot=-terminals
    This option allows setting the options for the terminal selected
    with =--format-of-hardcopy=. This overrides any default set in
    configuration section =[Plotting]= under the name
    =hardcopyOptions_<term>= with =<term>= being the name of the
    terminal (for instance for =png= the option is =hardcopyOptions_png=.
*** =pyFoamPrepareCase.py= writes state information about what it is currently doing
    It writes to the usual state file. This way =pyFoamListCases.py=
    will list this information. If the scripts call =pyFoamRunner.py=
    then this information will be overwritten
*** =pyFoamBinarySize.py= can handle new location of binaries in OpenFOAM 3.0
    Since that foam version all binaries (and object files are located
    in the directory =platforms=. The utility now finds them there
*** =Runner=-utilites now can signal on =blink(1)=-devices
    With the option =--use-blink1= these utilities now flash on a
    plugged in =blink(1)= USB-device for every time-step
*** =pyFoamExecute.py= can flash a =blink(1)=
    To indicate that the utility is still running it is able to play a pattern on a
    =blink(1)=-device. This is switched on with =-use-blink=
*** =pyFoamDecompose.py= allows using a template file
    With the option =--template-dict= it is possible to initialize the
    output with an existing file. With this file it is possible to add
    'complicated' settings.
*** =pyFoamTimelinePlot.py= now handles new format of probe files
    Probe files now have one comment line per probe to specify the
    position. This format is now correctly detected and plotted. Old
    probe files are also handled
*** =ReST=-report of =pyFoamPrepareCase.py= now reports derived parameters
    The =.rst=-file written by the utility now adds a section on
    derived parameters if such parameters were specified in a script
*** =pyFoamPrepareCase= can now ignore directories
    It is now possible to specify directories that should be ignored
    when looking for templates. Some sensible defaults like
    =postProcessing=, =processor*= and =VTK= are already set
*** =pyFoamConvertToCSV.py= allows adding formulas to XLSX-files
    The option =--add-formula-to-sheet= allows adding formulas to the
    Excel-sheet. Something like
: --add-formula="massflow:::'inlet'-'outlet'"
    adds a column =massflow= that subtracts the columns =inlet= and =outlet=
*** =pyFoamListCases.py= now displays mercurial info
    For those who use mercurial to keep track of their cases the
    utility now has the option =-hg-info= that displays the mercurial
    hash-ID, the local id and the branch name
*** Progress bar added to utilities with long run-time
    Using the library =lqdm= progress bars have been added to
    utilities that have a long run-time and where the progress bars
    are not disturbing the regular output. These utilities are
    - =pyFoamListCases.py=
    - =pyFoamBinarySize.py=
    Bars can be switched off with =--no-progress-bar=
*** Utilities that clear data can now report what is cleared
    =pyFoamCleasCase.py= and all utilities that have a =--clear=
    option now also have a =--verbose-clear= option that reports
    *what* is being cleared
*** =pyFoamConvertToCSV.py= now allows manipulating the input
    The utility now has two new options:
    - --strip-characters :: This allows removing characters before the
         file is actually read
    - --replace-first-line :: Replaces the first line (for instance if
         the header does not match the data
** Enhancements to the Library
*** Detection of =OpenFOAM-dev=
    A development installation is now also detected and it is assumed
    that this uses the new calling convention. Also: PyFoam reports
    this as version =9.9.9= (as this is larger than any version in the
    foreseeable future
*** Add =OpenFOAM+= as a fork
    An additional fork type =openfoamplus= has been added (in addition
    to =openfoam= and =extend=). Installations of the form
    =OpenFOAM-vX.X+= (with =X.X= being the version number) are added
    to this fork. Also =OpenFOAM-plus= is added as the development
    version of this fork
*** Accept new convention for location of =blockMeshDict=
    In newer OpenFOAM-versions =blockMeshDict= may be located in
    =system=. PyFoam detects it either there or in the old
    =constant/polyMesh=-location
*** Handling of complex data by =Configuration=
    Lists and dictionaries now can also be specified. Have to be
    correctly formatted if they are longer than one line (indented by
    at least one space - convention for configuration files)
*** =Configuration= has method =getArch= for architecture dependent settings
    If an option =opt= is requested with this option then it is
    checked whether an architecture-dependent setting exists.
    Architecture =arch= is the output of the =uname=-command. The
    architecture-dependent name is =opt_arch=.
*** =execute=-method from =PyFoam.Basics.Utilities= returns status-code
    This function now has an option that makes it return the status of
    the execution as well as the output of the execution.
*** =BasicRunner= now supports more ways of stopping runs
    In the past this class (and the utilities based on it) looked for
    a file =stop= and stopped the run (with writing) if it was
    found. Now two additional files are looked for
    - stopWrite :: this waits for the next scheduled write and then stops the run
    - kill :: gracefully stops the run without any writing
*** Added =Blink1= class to support =blink(1)= devices
    This class assumes that a =blink(1)= USB-device is present and the
    API-server (from the =Blink1Control=-program for this is
    running. It wraps these calls so that utilities can use them
    conveniently
*** =ParsedParameterFiles= now supports =includeEtc=
    =#includeEtc= is now supported
*** Parses uniform fields correctly
    Uniform fields of the form =1002{42.5}= (Field with 1002 values
    $42.5$) are now correctly parsed
*** =toNumpy=-method added to =Unparsed= and =Field=
    These two classes have a method =toNumpy= added that transformed
    the data into a structured =NumPy=-array. There are no
    applications for this in =PyFoam= yet but an application will be
    the parsing of lagrangian data
*** Added module =PyFoam.RunDictionary.LagrangianPatchData= to read data from patch function object
    This module reads data written by the cloud function-object that
    writes particle data as particles hit the patches and transforms
    it into =numpy=-array. Which can also be returned as =pandas=
    =DataFrames=

    It adds some properties to the data
    - the patch name
    - the time at which this data was written
    - a =globalId= constructed from =origId= and =origProcId=
*** Added module =PyFoam.RunDictionary.LagrangianCloudData= to read cloud data
    This gets
    - a case
    - a cloud name
    - a time name and reads the lagrangian data from the specified
      time and converts it to a pandas =DataFrame=

    A =globalId= that is consistent with the one in =LagrangianPatchData= is set
*** Method =code= added to =RestructuredTextHelper
    This method formats a string assuming that it is a program
    code. Default value is =python=
*** =ParsedParameterFile= now parses new dimension format correctly
    Newer OpenFOAM-versions allow dimensions in symbolic format (for
    example =[ m s^-1 ]=). These are now correctly parsed
*** =ParsedParameterFiel= now parses uniform fields correctly
    Fields of the form =23 { 4.2 }= (meaning "23 times 4.2") are now
    correctly parsed
** Infrastructure
*** Change of documentation from =epydoc= to =sphinx=
    As =expydoc= is discontinued the API-documentation is now generated
    with =sphinx=. Just run
: make docu
    to do so.

    Advantage is that now with
: make docset
    a document set for offline searching with =Dash= (for Mac OS X) or
    clones (on other OSes) can be generated
*** Adaptions to the unittests
    Untitests only used to run correctly if the OpenFOAM-version was
    1.7. Are changed to run with OF 3.0. No effort has been made to
    support intermediate versions as the changes are mainly about
    changed tutorials
** Bug fixes
*** Wrong format of =ExecutionTime= breaks plotting utilities
    If the =ExecutionTime= is not as expected =pyFoamPlotWatcher.py=
    and =pyFoamPlotRunner.py= finish with an error. This is now more
    robust
*** =phases= not working with dynamic plots
    For dynamic plots the addition of the phase name did not work. Fixed
*** Phase name added to function object output
    If =phase= was set the output of the function objects got it added
    to the names even though the function objects do not belong to the
    phase. This is fixed
*** One region mesh too many in utilities that change the boundary
    When working with regions one region too many was added in
    =pyFoamChangeBoundaryType.py= and =pyFoamChangeBoundaryName.py=. Fixed
*** =pyFoamClearCase.py= fails on write-protected case
    If a case is write protected then the utility failed. Now it only
    issues a warning and continues cleaning
*** Copying of directories in =pyFoamPrepareCase.py= confused by zipped files
    When copying one file to another and one of them is zipped then
    copying doesn't replace the destination correctly but adds the
    zipped/unzipped variant
*** Wrong times for multi-view layouts in =pyFoamPVSnapshots.py=
    If snapshots were taken from state files with multiple layouts
    then some of the views had the wrong time (either that from the
    state-file or from the timestep before). Fixed
*** First timestep not plotted (and not stored)
    The data from the first timestep was not plotted under certain
    circumstances. This has been fixed
*** =DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH= not passed on /Mac OS X 10.11/
    Starting with this OS-version as a security feature the system
    does not pass =LD_LIBRARY_PATH= and =DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH= to a
    shell. =PyFoam= detects this and creates these variables and makes
    sure they are passed to the processes
*** Newer versions of =pandas= broke the writing of excel files with =pyFoamConvertToCSV.py=
    The reason is that the old way of making axis data unique did not
    work anymore. This has been fixed
*** Capital =E= in exponential notation for floats breaks parser
    This problem has been reported at
    [[https://sourceforge.net/p/openfoam-extend/ticketspyfoam/220/]]
    (the number =1E-2= is not correctly parsed to =0.01=) and has been fixed
*** =Runner=-utilities clear processor directories if first time in parallel data differs
    In cases where the parallel data has a different start directory
    than $0$ the =pyFoamRunner.py= and similar utilities cleared that
    data and made a restart impossible. This has been fixed
*** Utilities =pvpython= not working when installed through =distutils=
    As the =distutils= (and all mechanisms built on these like =pip=)
    replace the used python in scripts the necessary =pvpython= was
    removed. This has been fixed by generating a temporary script file
    that is actually executed with =pvpython)
** ThirdParty
*** Added =tqdm= for progress bars
    Add the library =tqdm= (https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) for adding
    progress bars to utilities.

    Library is under =MIT= License
* Version 0.6.5 - 2015-06-01
** Major changes
*** PyFoam now on /Python Package Index/
    PyFoam is now found at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyFoam

    Recommended way of installing is using https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/ :
: pip install PyFoam
    This will also make sure that the required =numpy=-package is
    installed
** Incompatibilities
*** =ArchiveDir= in =SolutionDirectory= discouraged
    As this was never really used it is discouraged (the option is
    still there).

    If you don't understand what this means it probably doesn't
    concern you
*** Pickled data files now written as binary
    All pickled files are now written and read in binary mode (as this
    was the only way that works consistently in Python 3). This *may*
    cause problems with old cases (but no effort has been made to
    check whether this problem actually exists)
*** The =PlotRunner= and =PlotWatcher= now don't strip spaces
    These two utilities now don't strip leading spaces from the read
    lines. This preserves formatting in the output but might break
    scripts that rely on these spaces.

    The old behaviour may be reset by overriding =stripSpaces= in
    section =SolverOutput= with a value =True=
*** Different column names in =pyFoamConvertToCSV.py=
    The enhanced naming of the columns might break scripts that rely
    on the old naming
*** =pyFoamChangeBoundaryName.py= and =pyFoamChangeBoundaryType.py= automatically modify =processorX=
    In previous versions these boundary files were not modified. Now
    they are. Scripts that rely on unchanged =boundary=-files in the
    =processorX=-directories might fail. Old behavior can be set with
    the =--no-processor=-option
** Bugfixes
*** Arbitrary commands in =TemplateFile= passed to file
    Lines with =$$= are passed to the file and make it syntactically incorrect.
    Fixed
*** Pickled files not opened in binary mode
    This caused problems in Python 3 were binary strings were not
    correctly written (actually: attempts to write them to a
    pickle-file made the application fail)
*** Additional fixes for Python 3
    In a number of classes/applications semantic differences between
    Python 2 and 3 makes these fail on Python 3. Changes are
    - Replace =map= with list comprehension where possible
    - Modify wrappings in =CTestRun= to work with Python3
    - Replace =print= with =print_=
    - Semantic difference in division of two integers: Python3 gives a
      floating point number as a result
*** =ParsedParameterFile= fails if "complete" dictionary is =#include= ed
    If an included dictionary has a header parsing failed. This is
    fixed by retrying the parsing with the header
*** =ParsedParameterFile= fails if there is more info after =#include=
    If there is for instance a =;= after an =#include= statement the
    regular OpenFOAM-parser ignores it. The PyFoam-parser failed. This
    has been fixed and the parser behaves like regular OpenFOAM
*** =pyFoamDisplayBlockMesh.py= not working with VTK 6
    Due to changes in the API the program did not work. This is now
    fixed and the program works with VTK 6 as well as VTK 5
*** =pyFoamCreateModuleFile.py= failed with environment variables containing ~=~
    In that case an overeager =split= created lists.

    Fix provided by Martin Beaudoin
*** Fix import in =GeneralVCSInterface=
    Change in the syntax of imports in Python 3 broke this
    one. Fixed. But doesn't matter as Mercurial doesn't support
    Python3
*** Support of old format in =ParsedBlockMeshDict= broken
    Wrong usage of indexes. Fixed
*** =TemplateFile= not correctly working in Python 3
    Reason was a different calling convention to the =exec=-function
    of Python. Fixed
*** Certain things not done by =pyFoamPrepareCase= in =--quiet= was set
    This was due to actions being on the same level as the
    debug-output. Fixed
*** Annoying warning at the start of the run
    For certain solvers the plot utilities issued a warning during a
    phase when no information about the current time is
    available. This is now fixed
*** Redirected values
not used when iterating over dictionaries
    When iterating over dictionaries with redirects the values in the
    redirected dictionaries were not used. This is now fixed
*** Behavior of Template-engine not consistent in Python3 and Python2
    Due to a difference in the behavior of the =eval=-function in
    Python 3 certain expressions (especially with list comprehension)
    failed. Fixed
*** Braces, brackets, parentheses in column name broke =RunDatabase=
    These characters were stripped out by /SQLite/. They are thus
    normalized to special character combinations (which will be
    denormalized after reading)
*** Finding of installations in alternate locations broken
    The algorithm to find (Open)FOAM-installations in alternate
    locations was broken. Now working again
*** Failing on 3.x if socket for server thread already occupied
    Due to a a change in the socket API if the socket for the network
    thread (usually port 18000) was already notified the program
    failed. Fixed. Tested on 2.7 as well
** Enhancements to Utilities
*** =pyFoamPrepareCase= recognizes multi-region cases
    If there are multiple regions and no =prepareMesh.sh= then it will
    try to execute =blockMesh= for the regions
*** =pyFoamPrepareCase= adds specialized templates
    With the option =--extension-addition= additional templates that
    override the regular templates can be specified.

    Application may be for instance special templates for
    =potentialFoam=
*** =pyFoamPrepareCase= keeps data generated by meshing script
    If the meshing stage generates a =0=-directory then data in that
    directory will be kept. This can be switched off if this is not
    the desired behaviour
*** =pyFoamPrepareCase= adds possibility for a file with default values
    If a file =default.parameters= is found in this directory then
    this file is automatically read. This file is read like a regular
    parameter-file but it can also have added information about the
    values:
    - if an entry is a dictionary and has the entries =description=
      and =values= then it is assumed that this is a /group of
      values/. These groups are only used for grouping in reports. The
      =values= are set in the global scope.

      Groups can be nested
    - if an entry is a dictionary and has the entries =description=
      and =default= then it is assumed that the dictionary holds
      meta-information about the value. The entry =default= is the
      value that is actually used.
    - an additional enty =options= in that dictionary specifies a list
      of valid values for that parameter. The utility fails if the set
      value is not in that list. This is useful for setting boundary
      condition types or similar entries where only a limited number
      of words is valid
    It is recommended that *all* used values are specified in this
    file as this will be used for reporting
*** =pyFoamPrepareCase= writes report about the variables
    The utility now writes a /Restructured Text/ file with a report
    about the variables. Information from =default.parameters= like
    groupings and =description= are used in this report. Also the
    default value and the actual value are reported.

    The file can be converted with a utility like =rst2pdf=
*** Gnuplot can be styled with default commands
    For all utilities that use Gnuplot as the backend for plotting
    there is now a configuration option =gnuplotCommands= in the
    =Plotting=-section with the usual =set= commands of Gnuplot. This
    is preset to display a grid and the y-axis.

    The settings can be reset with the =gnuplotCommands=-list in the
    =customRegexp=-entries
*** =pyFoamPVSnapshot.py= now supports Paraview 4.2 and later
    The API for screenshots changed with Paraview 4.2 and later. This
    API now supports layouts if multiple views were specified. The
    default behaviour is now to make only one screenshot per
    layout. The old behaviour (one screenshot per view) can now be
    switched on with the =-no-layouts=-option.

    This allows screenshots exactly the way they look on screen
*** =pyFoamPVSnapshot.py= allows switching between decomposed and reconstructed data
    The utility now rewrites the state file so that either decomposed
    or reconstructed data is read. The default is that the data set
    for which more timesteps exist is selected
*** =pyFoamPVSnapshot.py= allows changing the field for sources
    It is now possible to specify a dictionary with source names and
    the fields that should be set for them. This allows quickly
    coloring the same layout with different fields.

    This works for
    - 3D (rendered) filters
    - bar charts
*** =pyFoamPVSnapshot.py= allows rescaling the color-legend
    There are now two ways to rescale the color-transfer functions
    - by specifying a dictionary with the ranges
    - by specifying a source. The range of the data on that source
      will be used to scale the data
      - when specifying a source percentiles can be specified for the
        highest and lowest percent of the cells to be ignored
    The first method will override the second
*** =pyFoamPVsnapshot= reads parameters written by =pyFoamPrepareCase.py=
    An option allows specifying that these parameters should be
    read. They are then available for substitution in the /Text/
    source
*** =pyFoamListCases.py= allows filtering
    The utility now has options to select the cases that should be
    considered by name of the case. Either substrings or globs can be
    used. Ignore patterns can be specified as well
*** =pyFoamRunParametervariation.py= now allows dictionaries
    The format of the parameter-file has been extended so that instead
    of values variations can be dictionaries. The contents of the
    dictionary are then used instead of a single value. An example
    would look like this
#+begin_src c++
defaults {
         a 1;
         b 2;
         c 3;
}

values {
       solver (
              interFoam
       );
       inVel ( 1 2 );
       outP ( 0 1 );
       sets (
            { name foo; a 3; }
            { name bar; b 4; c 5; }
       );
}
#+end_src
    where sets has two variations. Values unset in =sets= will be used
    from =defaults=
*** =pyFoamConvertToCSV.py= now has all functionality of =pyFoamJoinCSV.py=
    Now all functionality of the =Join=-utility is present in the =Convert=
    utility (including interpolating times)

    =pyFoamJoinCSV.py= will be removed in future versions of =PyFoam=
*** =dynamic= in =customRegexp= now allows composition from multiple match-groups
    If =idNr= is a list then now the actual id is composed from all
    the match groups specified in that list. If =idNr= is an integer
    then it behaves like it used to.

    Application for the new behavior would be for instance to have the
    flow of different species on different patches in one plot
*** New type =dynamicslave= in =customRegexp=
    This combines the properties of the types =dynamic= and =slave=:
    dynamically generated data sets that are added to another plot
*** Additional profiling option =--profile-line-profiler=
    Uses the library =line_profiler= for profiling. Only of interest
    for developers. Experimental
*** Utilities that use templates can be customized with the configuration
    The section =Template= in the configuration now allows modifying
    the behavior of the templating engine (how templates are processed
    and syntax details)
*** =LocalConfigPyFoam= now can be read *before* argument parsing
    This allows overruling options before they are set be command line
    options. This has to be enabled by the application (it doesn't
    make sense for all).

    An example is the =pyFoamPrepareCase.py=-utility where the local
    configuration file can overrule the default behavior of the
    template engine
*** =pyFoamConvertToCSV.py= automatically selects the output format with =--automatic-format=
    Now if that option is selected and the extension of the output is
    =xls= the option =-write-excel-file= doesn't have to be set
    anymore
*** =pyFoamConvertToCSV.py= allows adding original data as separate sheets
    The input data files now can be added to an excel-file as separate
    sheets with the =--add-sheets=-option
*** =pyFoamConvertToCSV.py= has improved naming of columns
    Now if there is more than one source file then the columns from
    the first source also get a unique prefix.

    It is also possible to clean the column names before writing them
    to file. The time name can be changed with
    =-write-time-name=. Substrings can be replaced with
    =--column-name-replace= and simple functions can be applied with
    =--column-name-transformation=
*** =pyFoamConvertToCSV.py= now supports sets-files
    The utility now can read these files and determine the field names
    from the filename. =--automatic= assumes that files with the
    extension =.xy= are of this format
*** =pyFoamPrepareCase.py= can calculate derived values with a script
    If a script =derivedParameters.py= is present then it is executed
    and values set in that script can be used in the templates as well
*** =pyFoamPrepareCase.py= adds a variable =numberOfProcessors=
    If unspecified by the user this variable is automatically $1$. It
    can be used by the templates to distinguish between different cases

    The =PrepareCaseJob=-class in =ClusterJob= automatically sets the
    values according to the number of processors in the cluster job
*** =pyFoamChangeBoundaryName.py= and =pyFoamChangeBoundaryType.py= now support decomposed cases
    Both utilities now also modify the boundary files in the
    =processorX=-direcories. This behaviour can be switched off from the command line
*** =pyFoamPrepareCase.py= has possibility for templates after the final stage
    Templates with the extension =.finalTemplate= are executed after
    the =caseSetup.sh=-script.
*** =pyFoamRunParameterVariation= allows adding postfix to cloned cases
    The option =--cloned-case-postfix= adds a postfix to the cloned
    directory names. This can be used if the results from multiple
    variations with the same parameter file should be kept (for
    instance when comparing OpenFOAM-versions)
*** =pyFoamConvertToCSV= now allows setting of default input file format
    The option =--default-read-format= now allows setting a different
    format than =csv= as the default format for input files
*** =pyFoamListCases.py= adds the hostname to the printed information
    The utility tries to determine from the pickled data the host the
    simulation was run on and prints it (can be switched off with an
    option)
*** =pyFoamPrepareCase.py= allows cloning
    The utility now has an option =--clone-case= to clone a new case
    before starting instead of working in the specified directory (in
    this case the case will be cloned to this directory). The name of
    the created directory *can* be constructed from the specified
    parameters with the =--automatic-casename=-option
** Enhancements to the Library
*** =SolutionDirectory= detects multiple regions
    Valid regions are sub-directories of =constant= that have a
    =polyMesh=-directory
*** =BoolProxy= now compares like builtin =bool=
    Comparison used to fail for types where it was not explicitly
    implemented like =None=
*** =PyFoamApplication=-class now supports =pvpython= for debugging
    Now =--interactive-after-exception= also works in the utilities
    that use =pvpython=
*** =TemplateFile= now allows more flexible assignments
    In the mode where executions are allowed now more flexible
    assignments to variables are possible. To be specific:
    - array assignments like
: $$ a["t"] = 2
    - multiple assignments like
: $$ a,b = 2,3
*** =ThirdParty=-library =six= upgraded to 1.9.0
    This library has been upgraded to the latest released version
*** Additional markup in =RestructuredTextHelper=
    There are additional methods =emphasis=, =strong= and =literal=
    that wrap their arguments in the appropriate markup

    The methods =bulletList=, =enumerateList= and =definitionList=
    take lists or dictionaries and mark them as lists
*** =SpreadsheetData= can now read files produced by the =sets=-functionObject
    If the option =isSampleFile= is set then it is assumed that the
    field names are in the filename and there is no header with field
    names in the file
** Infrastructure
*** Adaption of Debian packaging to new conventions
    By Oliver Borm. The building of Debian packages for Python
    libraries has changes. Necessary adaptions were done by Oliver Borm
** Development changes
*** Now uses =pytest= for unittesting
    The =nose=-library had problems and all the unit-tests run
    out-of-the-box with =pytest=
* Version 0.6.4 - 2014-11-24
** Requirements
   The only requirement is a python-installation. The main testing and
   development has been done with 2.7 and 2.6. Python 2.5 should work
   but not for all utilities. Currently 2.6, 2.7 and 3.4 are used
   during development.

   Certain functionalities need special Python-libraries. The main one
   is =numpy= for plotting. Other libraries that might be of interest
   are =matplotlib=, =pandas= and =IPython=. For
   =pyFoamDisplayBlockmesh.py= the libraries =PyQt4= and =vtk= are
   needed. Other libraries are tested for and reported by
   =pyFoamVersion.py= but not required (only install if you're sure
   that you need it)
** Future changes
*** Redundant utilities =pyFoamJoinCSV.py= and =pyFoamConvertToCSV.py= unified
    These two utilities are almost indistinguishable and will be
    unified into one
** Major changes
*** Multi-line regular expressions in =customRegexp=
    If in =customRegexp= an =expr= is found with =\n= then this
    expression is matched over multiple consecutive lines. Types like
    =dynamic= work as usual.

    This makes it possible to match for instance the output of the
    =forces=-function objects
*** Enhancement of =pyFoamPrepare.py=
    The utility which was introduced in the last version is becomong
    more usable and will be central to all things that set up the case
    (for instance a special =ClusterJob=)
*** Enhancements of the CSV-utilities
    These utilities are now more flexible and allow writing and
    reading of Excel-files too
*** Environment variable =PYFOAM_SITE_DIR= and =PYFOAM_DIR=
    Both variables are not necessary but =PYFOAM_SITE_DIR= allows
    consistent insertion of site-specific libraries and utilities.

    =PYFOAM_DIR= is set by some Foam-distributions and tested for by
    =pyFoamVersion.py=. It is supposed to point to the currents
    PyFoam-installation.

    =PYFOAM_SITE_DIR= points to a directory with site-specific scripts
    and configurations. The sub-directories supported (and thested py
    =pyFoamVersion.py=) are
    - bin :: directory with scripts. It has to be added to the =PATH=
             outside of PyFoam (for instance in the =.bashrc=)
    - etc :: Optional directory which is searched for configuration
             files. Priority is below the user settings and above the
             global settings
    - lib :: Optional directory to allow mixing in site-specific
             library files. Imported as =PyFoam.Site=: For instance if
             a file =Foo.py= is present in =lib= it can be imported as
             =PyFoam.Site.Foo=. This directory does not have to be (in
             fact: it *shouldn't*) added to =PYTHONPATH=
    Purpose of =PYFOAM_SITE_DIR= is to allow administrators to provide
    site-wide scripts and settings for all users on a site
** Incompatibilities
*** Option =--silent= removed from =pyFoamPrepareCase.py=
    Option has been renamed to =--no-complain=
*** Keys in =RunDatabase= with column-names that contain upper-case letters change
    SQLite does not support case-sensitive column-names (=s_max= and
    =S_max= are the same). To change this the upper case letters in
    the column names are replaced by an underscore and the letter
    (=S_max= becomes =_s__max=)

    This means that old databases might not be read correctly
*** Change in unique variable names in =pyFoamConvertToCSV.py=
    The algorithm to make variable names unique has changed (basically
    it uses the part of the filenames that differ) and scripts relying
    on these names might fail
*** =PyFoam.IPython=-module renamed to =PyFoam.IPythonHelpers=
    The name of the module crashed in certain instances (especially
    unit-testing) with the regular =IPython=-library. To avoid these
    crashes it has been renamed to =IPythonHelpers=. This raises two
    potential problems:
    - scripts that =import= the module have to be adapted to the new name
    - IPython-notebooks created with =pyFoamIPythonNotebook.py= have
      two imports pointing to this module. These notebooks have to be
      adapted to be usable again
** Bugfixes
*** Templates in =pyFoamPrepareCase.py= did not keep permissions
    This was a problem for script-templates which were not executable
    any more. Fixed
*** =pyFoamComparator.py= failed due to circular dependency
    This has been fixed by adding an import in =BasicRunner.py=
*** =pyFoamDumpRunDatabaseToCSV.py= fails if Pandas-data is requested
    This is now fixed
*** =sort= for list broke code on Python 3
    Some calls for =sort= still used the =cmp=-parameter which does
    not exist for Python3 anymore. These calls have been replaced with
    =key= and =reverse=
*** Changing the OF-version does not work in Python 3
    Because the output of =subprocess= is now /binary/ instead of a
    regular string. Fixed
*** =addData= in =PyFoamDataFrame= extrapolates for invalid values
    This was due to incorrect use of the =interpolate=-method
*** =--keep-last= did not work for =pyFoamClearCase.py= and parallel cases
    This was because there was a problem in the library code and the
    utility did not consider the parallel time-steps. Fixed
*** =pyFoamDumpRunDatabaseToCSV.py= does not add basic run information
    Basic run information was not added to the file. Now it is with
    the prefix =runInfo//=
*** Restore of =FileBasisBackup= did not work
    The logic for checking whether a file was "backupable" was
    wrong. This affected the proper restore of files with utilities
    for instance for =--write-all=
*** Remove circular dependency in =DataStructures=
    According to the bug
    http://sourceforge.net/p/openfoam-extend/ticketspyfoam/219/ it was
    not possible to import =DataStructures= because of a circular
    dependency with =FoamFileGenerator=. Fixed by moving an import to
    the back of the file
** New features/Utilities
*** =pyFoamRunParameterVariation.py=
    This utility takes a template case and a file specifying the
    parameter variation and creates cases with the
    =pyFoamPrepareCase.py=-engine, runs a solver on these cases and
    collects the data into a database. The database can then be
    extracted with =pyFoamDumpRunDatabaseToCSV.py=
*** =pyFoamBinarySize.py=
    Calculates the size of the binaries in an OpenFOAM-installation
    separated by compile-option
*** =pyFoamBlockMeshRewrite.py=
    Assists the user in rewriting the =blockMeshDict= by doing simple,
    but error-prone transformations. Assumes "sensible" formatting:
    one block/vertex etc per line.

    Sub-commands are:
    - refine :: refines mesh by multiplying cell numbers in the blocks
    - number :: Adds comments with the vertex numbers. Should help the
                user when editing/modifying the mesh
    - stripNumber :: Remove the comments added by =number=
    - mergeVertices :: Adds vertices from other blockMeshes that
                       are not present in the current blockMesh
    - renumberVertices :: Take another =blockMeshDict=, copy over the
         =vertices=-section of that mesh and rewrite =blocks= and
         =patches= so that they conform to these =vertices=. The
         original =vertices= have to be a sub-set of the =vertices= in
         the other mesh
    - normalizePatches :: Rotates patches so that the lowest number is
         in front
** Enhancements to Utilities
*** =pyFoamChangeBoundaryType.py= allows setting additional values
    The option =--additional-values= allows specifying a dictionary
    with additional values for the boundary (stuff that is needed by
    =mappedWall= etc)
*** =pyFoamPrepareCase.py= now has OF-version and fork as defined variables
    This allows to write case-templates that can distinguish between
    different OF-versions
*** =pyFoamPrepareCase.py= now allows "overloading" another directory
    Before doing anything else the contents of different directories
    are copied into the current case. This allows for instance to use
    tutorial cases as the basis for a case
*** =pyFoamIPythonNotebook.py= adds improvements to the notebook
    Additional code added to the generated notebook:
    - Code to change the default size of the plots
    - Distribution-directories in subdirectories =distributions=
      (generated by some =swak=-function objects) added
*** =pyFoamListCases.py= more tolerant to faulty =controlDict=
    If the =controlDict= is acceptable to OpenFOAM but syntactically
    incorrect for PyFoam (for instance because of a missing semicolon)
    the utility does not fail anymore (but no data is collected for
    that case).
*** =pyFoamDumpConfiguration.py= prints sections and keys alphabetically
    This should make it easier to find items
*** =pyFoamJoinCSV.py= and =pyFoamConvertToCSV.py= read and write Excel-files
    Both utilities now allow writing Excel-files

    In addition to regular text files the first sheet from =xls=-files
    can be read
*** Flexible variable filtering in =pyFoamJoinCSV.py= and =pyFoamConvertToCSV.py=
    Now it is possible to filter for regular expressions

    The functionality of the two utilities now is very similar and it
    is possible that one of them will be discontinued
*** Columns in =pyFoamJoinCSV.py= and =pyFoamConvertToCSV.py= can be recalculated
    The two utilities now can add columns or recalculate columns
    based on the existing column values
*** Testing for =Numeric= removed from =pyFoamVersion.py=
    Testing for the library =Numeric= library removed as it is no
    longer supported as a fallback for =numpy=. Test also removed from
    =setup.py=
** Enhancements to the Library
*** Subclass of =ClusterJob= that support =PrepareCase=
    The class =PrepareCaseJob= supports cases that are set up with
    =pyFoamPrepareCase.py=. Additional parameters to the constructor are
    - the name of the parameter-file
    - a list with the parameters. The list is composed of
      name/value-pairs
*** Subclass of =ClusterJob= that support =RunParameterVariation=
    The class =VariationCaseJob= supports cases that are set up with
    =pyFoamRunParameterVariation.py=. Additional parameters to the constructor are
    - the name of the parameter-file
    - the name of the variations-file
*** =execute= in =PyFoam/Utilities= fails if script is not executable
    The function checks if the file exists and is *not*
    executable. The program fails in that case
*** =foamVersion= uses a separate wrapper class for =tuple=
    This ensures that it is printed in a form that is valid in
    OF-dictionaries
*** Move calculation of disk usage to =Utilities=
    This has until now only been used in =ListCases= but moved to a
    separate method/function =diskUsage= in the =Utilities=-module
*** Enhancement of =--help=
    Added the possibility to have an epilog and usage examples with
    the =epilog= and  =examples=-keyword arguments for applications.

    These and descriptions now have the possibility for line-breaks:
    if two line-breaks are encountered in the text a new paragraph is
    created
*** =which=-routine in =Utitlities= uses native Python-routine
    For Python-version where =shutil= has a =which=-function this is
    used instead of calling an external program
*** =FileBasis= now allows file handles instead of the filename
    This currently only works for reading, Backups, zipping etc won't
    work but it makes algorithms more flexible
*** =BlockMesh= doesn't force writing to file anymore
    Instead content is stored in memory. Old behaviour is the default
    to preserve compatibility with old scripts
*** Additional methods for =BlockMesh=-class
    - numberVertices :: Adds comments with the vertex numbers to the
                        vertices
*** =LineReader= allows keeping spaces on left
    Previous behaviour was stripping all spaces from the lines. Now
    the left hand spaces can be ket. Old behaviour is still default
    for compatibility
*** =TemplateFile= now allows writing of assignment-results in file
    This allows faster debugging of template-files. This can be
    enabled with a switch in the utilities using templates
*** =SolverJob= now allows passing of parameters to the solver
    And additional parameter =solverArgs= will now be passed to the
    solver (if the solver accepts arguments)
*** =SpreadsheetData= now allows reading from an Excel file
    During construction if an Excel-file is specified and the
    =xlrd=-library and =pandas= are installed then the first sheet in
    the file is read
*** =SpreadsheetData= allows recalculating columns
    Columns can be recalculated using expressions. This includes other
    data items. Currently present column names are available as
    variables. There is also a variable =data= that can be subscripted
    for items that are not valid variable names. A variable =this=
    points to the item to be recalculated
** Known bugs
*** Timelines not forgotten for multiple runner calls
    This manifests with =pyFoamRunParameterVariation.py=. The custom
    timelines are still kept in memory. Not a problem. Just annoying
* Version 0.6.3 - 2014-06-23
** Requirements
   The only requirement is a python-installation. The main testing and
   development has been done with 2.7 and 2.6. Python 2.5 should work
   but not for all utilities. Unit tests run on Python 3.4 but it is
   currently not used in a production environment (reports of success
   or failure most welcome)

   Certain functionalities need special Python-libraries. The main one
   is =numpy= for plotting. Other libraries that might be of interest
   are =matplotlib=, =pandas= and =IPython=. For
   =pyFoamDisplayBlockmesh.py= the libraries =PyQt4= and =vtk= are
   needed. Other libraries are tested for and reported by
   =pyFoamVersion.py= but not required (only install if you're sure
   that you need it)
** Major changes
*** Version changing supports forks of OpenFOAM
    Now =pyFoam= supports different versions of OpenFOAM for switching.
    Out of the box =openfoam= and =extend= are supported. If only the
    version number is specified (for instance by =--foamVersion=1.7.x=)
    and such a version exists only for one fork it is correctly
    expanded with the correct fork( in the example with
    =openfoam-1.7.x=). If more than one fork has the same version then
    the fork name has to be specified as well

    Note: additional forks can be easily specified with the
    configurations. In section =OpenFOAM= the parameter =forks= has to
    be extended. For each new fork a =dirpatterns= and
    =installation=-parameter has to be specified
** Incompatibilities
*** Change of command interface of =pyFoamSTLUtility.py=
    The selection of what is to be done is now selected by subcommands
    instead of options. This will break scripts using this
*** If =0.org= is present =pyFoamCloneCase.py= and =pyFoamPackCase.py= ignore =0=
    The reason is that the utilities assume that this directory is
    produced from =0.org=
** Bugfixes
*** PlotWatcher has long times between updates if pickling takes long
    The reason was that it used the same throttling that made sense
    for the PlotRunner. Fixed
*** =pyFoamPVSnapshot.py= fails for newer paraview-versions
    Reason is that the class =vtkPythonStdStreamCaptureHelper= does
    not support =isatty=
*** SamplePlot failed when valueNames are unspecified
    Reported in
    https://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=208
    and fixed
*** =pyFoamTimelinePlot.py= failed Numpy/Pandas output of vector fields
    Vector fields only were added to the data fields if they were the
    first in the list. Fixed
*** =alternateAxis= ignored for slave
    This is now fixed. The alternate values have to be specified in
    the master (specifying in the slave gives an error)
*** =pyFoamCaseReport.py= more stable for binary =boundary=-files
    Usually these files are =ascii= (even if the header says
    =binary=). In some cases the parsing failed for these. Fixed by
    enforcing reading as =ascii=. Can be switched off
*** =SpreadsheetData= returns data which breaks certain Pandas-operations
    The reason was that if there were duplicate times in the table the
    index was non-unique which certain Pandas-operations don't
    appreciate. Solved by dropping duplicate times. Can be switched off
*** =pyFoamCloneCase.py= added duplicates to the archive
    If things are specified twice they were added twice. Now it is
    checked whether the item already exists in the tar-file before
    adding them
*** =nonuniform= of length 3 not correctly printed
    The reason was that this was interpreted as a vector and the
    numeric prefix was removed. Reported at
    http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=218

    Fixed by introducing an extra parameter to =FoamFileGenerator=
** New features/Utilities
*** =pyFoamPrepareCase.py= for case preparation
    This utility aims to reduce the need for boilerplate scripts to
    set up cases. The steps it executes are
    1. Clear old data from the case (including processor directories)
    2. if a folder =0.org= is present remove the =0= folder too
    3. go through all folders and for every found file with the
       extension =.template= do template expansion using the
       pyratemp-engine
    4. create a mesh (either by using a script or if a =blockMeshDict=
       is present by running blockMesh. If none of these is present
       assume that there is a valid mesh present)
    5. copy every =foo.org= that is found to to =foo= (recursively if directory)
    6. do template replacement for every =.postTemplate=
    7. execute another preparation script
*** =pyFoamIPythonNotebook.py= for generating and manipulating IPython-notebooks
    This utility creates and manipulates IPython-notebooks for
    analyzing OpenFOAM cases. It has a number of subcommands:
    - create :: this is the main command. All other commands assume
                that the notebooks they work with were created with
                this.

		The utility looks at the case specified and creates a
                notebook that has the capabilities to quickly build a
                report about the case:
      - reporting general properties of the case. This
	basically is the capability of the
	=pyFoamCaseReport.py=-utility
      - It searches for data that can be visualized by
        =pyFoamTimelinePlot.py= or =pyFoamSamplePlot.py= and
        generates selectors that allow the user to select
        which data to import. The selectors import the data as
        Pandas-=DataFrames= and create the commands
        necessary to do this. It is recommended to erase the
        selector afterwards
      - Selectors for pickled case data and pickled plot
        generated by PyFoam
      - Capability to store read data *in* the notebook
        file. This feature is experimental and has
        performance issues for medium to large datasets
      The created notebook can be executed but needs to be
      edited to be useful
    - clear :: removes selected cells (but only cells created with
               =create=) or output from the notebook.
    - info :: prints information about the notebook
    - copy :: copies notebook to a different case and rewrites it so
              that data is read from that case
    Recommended way of working with this utility is
    1. Create notebook with utility
    2. Edit it to contain standardized evaluations
    3. Copy it over to another, similar case
*** Additional sub-module =PyFoam.IPython=
    The purpose of this submodule is to support
    =pyFoamIPythonNotebook.py=. It has the classes
    - Notebook :: read a file and interpret it as an
                  IPython-notebook. Do manipulations on this notebook
    - PermanentStorage :: Implements permanent storage in an
         IPython-notebook. Only works inside a notebook and allows
         only one instance at once. Passing the data from the notebook
         (through JavaScript) to Python currently is a performance
         bottleneck
    - Case :: Convenience object that exposes the functionality of
              some of the PyFoam-utilities through a simple interface
*** Additional sub-module =PyFoam.Wrappers=
    Wraps popular Python-libraries to add functions that make it
    easier to work with OpenFOAM-data.

    Currently only one Wrapper is implemented:
**** =Pandas=-wrappers
     This provides =PyFoamDataFrame= as a wrapper for =DataFrame=. The
     functionality added is
     - addData :: Conveniently add new data from different =Series=,
                  =DataFrames=. It is assumed that the index is the
                  same property (time or for samples the distance) but
                  with a different resolution. The indexes are joined
                  and missing data is interpolated
     - integrate, validLength, weightedAverage :: uses the index as
          the $x$-axis and calculates these properties for a
          =Series=. =validLength= is the extent on which data is
          defined (=weightedAverage= is basically =integrate= divided
          by =validLength=). For =integrate= the trapezoid-rule is used
     - describe :: adds the three above quantities to the regular
                   =describe=-command
** Enhancements to Utilities
*** =pyFoamSampleplot= has option to use index instead of time in filenames
    The option =-index-instead-of-filename= switches this on. This
    makes it easier to generate movies from the files
*** =pyFoamListCases.py= Allows addition of custom data
    The option =--custom-data= now allows the specification of custom
    data items. These are read from the =pickledData=-files and
    displayed in the table like regular data items
*** Switch compiler versions
    Now all utilities allow switching the compiler version (for
    instance from =Gcc47= to =Gcc48=). The relevant options are
    =--force-system-compiler=, =--force-openfoam-compiler= and
    =--force-compiler=
*** =pyFoamVersion.py= reports the installed versions better
    Now the location of the installations is reported as well
*** Offscreen rendering can be switched off in =pyFoamPVSnapshot.py=
    This is a workaround where the writer produces a segmentation
    fault
*** Write 3D-data in =pyFoamPVSnapshot.py=
    In addition to writing out bitmaps allows writing out 3D-data (for
    importing into other applications). Sources can be selected by name
*** Added capabilities to =pyFoamSTLUtility=
    The utility can now also:
    - erase selected patches
    - merge selected patches into one
*** =pyFoamDecomposer.py= switches off function objects
    This now automatically happens for OF-versions that support
    it (2.0 and greater). They can be switched on again
*** =pyFoamCloneCase.py= clones more stuff
    Files that are assumed to be used by =pyFoamPrepareCase.py= are
    automatically added to the clone. This includes all files (and
    directories) with the extensions =.sh=, =.template= and
    =.org=. Also IPython notebooks (extension =.ipynb= are added)
** Enhancements to the Library
*** =BasicRunner= now can print the command line that is actually used
    This should help with diagnosing problems with MPI etc.

    Can be switched on in some utilities with =--echo-command-prefix=
*** =ClusterJob= now can live without a machinefile
    Using the machine-file now can be switched off for job-schedulers
    with a tight integration
*** Enhanced treatment of symlinks during cloning
    If a item in the case itself is a symlink then it used to be a
    copy of the file the symlink is pointing to. Now it is created as
    a symlink to the target the original symlink. If the
    =--follow-symlink=-option is used the old behaviour is used
    (copying). In this case the option =noForceSymlink= in the
    =Cloning=-section of the configuration can be used to change this
    behaviour for selected files
*** =AnalyzedCommon= clears the =analyzed=-directory
    The directory is cleared if it exits from a previous run.
*** =TimelineDirectory= is more tolerant
    Used to fail if incompatible data types were used. Now ignores
    them
*** Possibility of a subcommand-interface for utilities
    The subclass =SubclassFoamOptionParser= now allows the parsing of
    subclasses. The base class for utilities =PyFoamApplication= now
    supports this as an option. As an example this is implemented in
    =pyFoamSTLUtilities.py=
*** =STLUtility= accepts file-handles
    The class checks whether arguments are filehandles and in this
    case doesn't try to open a file for reading or writing but uses
    the handle
*** =addClone= in =SolutionDirectory= accepts glob patterns
    If no file matching the name is found it is assumed that this is a
    glob-pattern and all matching files are added. This affects all
    utilities that use that method (especially =pyFoamCloneCase.py=)
*** =execute= in =Utilities= allows specification of working directory and echoing of output
    This method now allows the specification of a working
    directory. Before executing the command the method changes to the
    working directory. Afterwards it changes back to the regular
    working directory.

    There is also an option =echo= that immediately prints the output
    to the screen
*** =rmtree= and =copytree= more tolerant
    =rmtree= now also works if the "tree" is a file.

    =copytree= now has a parameter =force= that allows removing the
    destination directory if it exists
*** Enhanced support for booleans in the parser
    Strings that are usually interpreted as boolean in OF-dictionaries
    (for instance =on=, =yes=, ...) are now stored as a special type
    that allows treating them like 'real' booleans.

    For instance an expression =test no;= in a dictionary now allows
    things like =if d['test']:= in the script
*** Application classes now allow specifying options as keyword parameters
    Until now the options to be used had to be specified as a list of
    string modeled on the way the command line looked like. This is
    still possible. In addition it is now possible to specify these
    things as keyword parameters on the command line. Rudimentary type
    checking is done. The names of the parameters are generated from
    the command line options: the =-= are removed and the words are
    converted to CamelCase. So for instance =--list-custom-Regexp =
    becomes =listCustomRegexp=. Also for switches like these a boolean
    value has to be passed. So the correct usage in a call would be
    ~listCustomRegexp=True~.
*** =SolutionDirector= now can classify directories in the =postProcessing=-directory
    A number of properties has been added that list data generated by
    function objects:
    - timelines :: timeline data (like =propes=) that can be
                   visualized by =pyFoamTimelinePlot.py=
    - samples :: data from =set= (assuming it is in =raw=-format) that
                 can be processed by =pyFoamSamplePlot.py=
    - surfaces :: data from =surface= (assumes =VTK=-format) that can
                  be used by =pyFoamSurfacePlot.py=
    - distributions :: special cases of =sample= with distribution
                       data
    These properties only list the subdirectories of the case with
    that data

    Additional properties are
    - pickledData :: a list of pickled data files that are found
    - pickledPlots :: list of found pickled plots
    These lists are sorted in descending temporal order (newest first)
*** =pyFoamSamplePlot.py= now more flexible for distributions
    Tries to determine the names of the values from the first line in
    the files
*** =DictProxy= now has a =dict=-like =update=-method
    This also allows enforcing string values
*** =FoamFileGenerator= automatically quotes strings
    If strings are unquoted but contain characters that make it
    illegal as a word then the string is quoted before output
*** Children of =FileBasis= now can be used with the =with=-statement
    This mainly concerns =ParsedParameterFile=
* Version 0.6.2 - 2013-11-03
** Major changes
*** Use of =pandas=-library
    Starting with this version the =pandas=-library is used for
    data-analysis. When possible and appropriate classes return
    =pandas=-objects. Currently these are:
    - =CSVCollection=. With a call-operator this class returns the
      collected data as a =DataFrame= of the collected data
    - =SpreadsheetData= now has methods to return =Series= and
      =DataFrame= objects

    It is not necessary to install =pandas= if these classes are not
    used (and even then most of their functionality works)
** Incompatibilities
*** Different separator for databases in CSV-files
    The class =RunDatabase= (and therefor also the utility
    =pyFoamDumpRunDatabaseToCSV.py=) now write as a separator for data
    from sub-tables a =//= instead of the space. This especially means
    that scripts that rely on a data-item =foo= in =analyzed= might
    break because this is now called =analyzed//foo= instead of
    =analyzed foo=. On the other hand this makes the names more
    consistent and easier to parse as =//= is the saperator for other
    levels of dictionaries
*** Change of independent variable name in sample data
    Instead of =col0= this is now =coord=. This could cause problems
    with scripts that use that column name in the resulting
    =SpreadsheetData=-object
** Bugfixes
*** =pyFoamPackCase.py= does not handle symbolic links correctly
    Symbolic links were copied as is and did not work correctly
    afterwards. This is fixed. If the symbolic link is an absolute
    path or points outside the case directory it is replaced with the
    file it points to. Otherwise it is preserved as a symbolic link
*** =pyFoamPotentialRunner.py= not working with OpenFOAM 2.0 or newer
    These versions require an entry =potentialFlow= in the
    =fvSolution=-file instead of the old =SIMPLE=
*** =pyFoamListCase.py= fails with =controlDict= that use preprocessing
    Fixed by first trying to read that with preprocessing. Without if
    that fails
*** Cloning fails in symlink-mode if files are specified twice
    Now using a =set= instead of a =list= makes sure that no file is
    cloned twice
** Utilities
*** =pyFoamPotentialRunner.py= now allows removing of =functions= and =libs=
    The utility now allows removing these entries in case that they
    don't work with =potentialFoam=
*** The Runner-utilities now have more options for clearing
    Some of the options of =pyFoamClearCase.py= for clearing cases
    (for instance specifying additional files) have been ported to the
    =Runner=-utilities. Also is the =postProcessing=-directory
    removed by default
** Library
*** =SolutionDirectory= and =TimeDirectory= are more tolerant
    If there are field files and their zipped counterpart than
    instead of an error a warning *can* be given
*** =ClusterJob= now handles template files
    A new method =templateFile= gets the name of a file which is
    constructed from a template of the same name plus the extension
    =.template=
*** Additional parameters in =ClusterJob=
    The method =additionalParameters= can return a dictionary with
    additional parameters
*** Custom data in directory easier accessible
    In the written data in the sub-dictionary =analyzed= there is now
    a subdictionary =Custom= with the values of the custom expressions
    with the prefix =CustomXX_= removed. This means that values that
    were available as
: data['Custom02_velCheck']['min']
    are now available as
: data['Custom']['velCheck']['min']
    The advantage is that the number part which was dependent on the
    order the expressions were specified is now no longer necessary
    (this should make scripts more stable)

    The old notation is still available but deprecated
*** =SolverJob= now allows compression of output
    The parameter =solverLogCompress= compresses the log-file while
    writing it to disc. *Attention:* This may lead to corrupted
    log-files if the run crashes
*** =PyFoamApplication=-class now allows quick access to data
    The dictionary returned by =getData()= now allows access to all
    the elements as attributes.
** New features/Utilities
*** Post-run hook that sends mail at the end of run
    The hook-module =MailToAddress= sends a mail at the end of a
    run. Prerequisite is an SMTP-Server that doesn't need
    authentication
*** New utility =pyFoamCompressCases.py=
    This utility goes through cases and compresses single files. The
    cases can be searched recursively to.

    Purpose of this utility is to shrink cases where
    =writeCompression= was not turned on during the run
*** Paraview-module to read additional data
    A new module =PyFoam.Paraview.Data= reads additional data usually
    written by OpenFOAM. These are converted to =vtkArray= using the
    following functions and can be used in =Programmable filters=:
    - setSampleData :: reads the data from sampled sets
    - setTimelineData :: reads data from a timeline directory
    - setPlotData :: reads pickled plot data using =RedoPlot=
** Enhancements
*** =pyFoamRedoPlot.py= can plot in XKCD-mode
    When used with the option =--implementation=xkcd= and version of
    =matplotlib= that supports it is installed then plots are done in
    the style of the webcomics [[http://xkcd.com]]
*** =pyFoamListCases.py= now displays disk usage in human readable form
    If the disk usage of the cases is calculated then it is displayed
    in human readable form (as KB, MB, GB or TB) for sizes larger than
    one Kilobyte
*** =pyFoamClearCase.py= more flexible in selection of data to be removed
    Options to be more flexible in removing data are added:
    - keep-interval :: keep timesteps at a specified interval. For
                       instance =--keep-interval=0.1= will keep times
                       like $1$, $1.1$ etc but remove $1.05$
    - keep-parallel :: this will not remove any times in the
                       =processor=-directories. Also are things like
                       =keep-last= now honored for processor directories
    - remove-analyzed :: Remove the directories with the analyzed data
         too. Old behavior was to remove them. Now they are kept by default
*** =pyFoamFromTemplate.py= automatically chooses template and default values
    If an output file =foo= is specified and no template then the
    utility looks for a file =foo.template= as a template.

    If a file =foo.defaults= is present then this file is read and
    used as default parameter values. Other specifications override
    these defaults
*** =pyFoamDumpRunDatabaseToCSV.py= can disable standard-fields
    Additional option =--disable-run-data=
*** =pyFoamDumpRunDatabaseToCSV.py= prints =pandas=-object
    With the =-pandas-print=-option a =DataFrame= is generated and
    printed
*** Better debugging with =ipdb=
    If the =ipdb=-package (basically =pdb= with =IPython=-additions)
    is installed then it is used. This gives additions like
    tab-completion
*** Interactive shell after execution for utilities
    The option =--interactive-after-execution= drops the user to an
    interactive shell where the namespace can be inspected. If present
    =IPython= will be used, otherwise the regular shell is used
*** Utilities that read quantitative data convert to =pandas=-data and/or =numpy=
    This is mainly to be used on the interactive shell to do further
    analysis or write this data out. The utilities are:
    - pyDumpRunDatabaseToCSV.py :: add an item =dump= with the whole
         data as a =DataFrame=
    - pyFoamTimelinePlot.py :: add element =series= with all the data
         as =Series= and =dataFrame= with the same data as a =DataFrame=
    - pyFoamSamplePlot.py :: Like =pyFoamTimelinePlot.py=
    - pyFoamRedoPlot.py :: Now can get series and the whole plot data
         as pandas-objects
*** Utilities that read quantitative data write Excel files
    The utilities =pyDumpRunDatabaseToCSV.py=,
    =pyFoamTimelinePlot.py=, =pyFoamSamplePlot.py= and
    =pyFoamRedoPlot.py= now have options to write Excel-files
*** Specify additional settings for =GnuPlot= in =customRegexp=
    If an item in =customRegexp= has an item =gnuplotCommands= then
    it is assumed that this is a list of strings which are executed
    before the first plotting. For instance
:           gnuplotCommands (
:              "set format y '%.2e'"
:            );
    changes the number format on the y-axis
*** More flexible data specification for =pyFoamSamplePlot.py=
    Instead of determining the names of the fields and lines form the
    filenames it is now also possible to specify them through options.

    The option =--is-distribution= is a shorthand that sets these
    options for distribution files
*** =pyFoamSamplePlot.py= now allows specification of x-range
    The range of the x-axis of the plots can either be set by
    automatically scaling to the domains of all the data sets with
    =--scale-domain= or by specifying them with =--domain-minimum= or
    =--domain-maximum=.

    These domains are set for *all* plots
* Version 0.6.1 - 2013-05-24
** Major changes
** Bugfixes
*** Restoring of =controlDict= after =write=
    When activating an on-demand write the =constrolDict= was not
    restored because the output-line about the file being read was not
    recognized (due to a change in the output in recent
    OF-versions). Now a number of different formats is recognized
*** Custom-plot type =slave= not working if no =master= defined
    That plot-type needs a =master=. Fixed to fail if none is defined
*** =-list-only= did not correctly parse lists with a numeric prefix
    This did affect all utilities that use that option and also calls
    with =listOnly= to the library class
** Utilities
*** =pyFoamBuildHelper.py= now allow more than one action
    If multiple actions like =--update= and =--build= are specified
    they are executed in a sensible order (update before build etc)
*** Utilities warn if OpenFOAM-version is unset
    If the environment variable that determines the OpenFOAM-version
    is unset a warning is issued by the utilities
*** =pyFoamUpgradeDictionariesTo20.py= allows single files
    If  single file is specified then the action to transform it has
    can be specified
*** =pyFoamUpgradeDictionariesTo20.py= transforms reaction-schemes
    Now knows how to transform "old" reaction files (where the
    =reactions=-entry was a list) to the new format (where it is a
    dictionary). Only a limited number of reaction types is supported.
*** =pyFoamUpgradeDictionariesTo20.py= transforms thermophysical data
    Now the old form of thermophysical data (lists) is transformed
    into the new dictionary-form
*** =pyFoamCloneCase= now allows creating directory that symlinks to the original
    Now with the option =--symlink-mode= instead of copying the
    directories from the original new directories art created and
    populated with symlinks to the files in the original. The depth
    until which no symlinks to directories are created can be
    specified. This allows the clone to share the configuration files
    with the original
*** =pyFoamClearCase.py= now removes =postProcessing= and allows removal of additional files
    The directory =postProcessing= is now automatically removed (can be
    switched off with =--keep-postprocessing=). Also with the
    =--additional=-option patterns with additional files to remove
    can be specified.
*** Improvements to =pyFoamVersion.py=
    - Now reports the location of the =python=-executable
    - Reports locations of used libraries
*** Additional files automatically cloned
    The files =Allrun=, =Allclean= and =0.org= are automatically
    added during cloning as these are often used by the standard-utilities
*** =pyFoamDisplayBlockMesh.py= uses the same options for template format as =pyFoamFromTemplate.py=
    This makes sure that templates are handled consistently and also
    allows different delimiters in the =blockMeshDict.template=
** Library
*** Improvements in syntax of =ParsedParameterFile=
    - Now the new relative scoping that was introduced in OF 2.2 is
      supported
*** =Utilities=-class now function to find files matching a pattern
    Added a function =find= that approxiamtes the =find=-command
*** VCS ignores more files
    Some more patterns have been added that will be ignored in a
    VSC-controlled case. All of them concerning files that PyFoam
    creates during operation
** New features/Utilities
*** New Utility =pyFoamSymlinkToFile.py=
    This utility replaces a symlink with a copy of the
    file/directories it points to. To be used after a
    =pyFoamCloneCase.py= in =--symlink-mode=
* Version 0.6.0 - 2013-03-14
** Major changes
*** Adaption to work with Python3
    Sources are adapted so that =PyFoam= works with Python3 too. This
    breaks support for Python 2.4 and earlier (possibly also Python
    2.5)

    Some of the Libraries in =PyFoam.ThirdParty= had to be adapted to
    work with Python3:
    - Gnuplot.py :: The original version 1.8 is quite old. It was
                    adapted with the help of the =six=-library (see
                    below) to work with Python2 and Python3 (inspired
                    by
                    [https://github.com/oblalex/gnuplot.py-py3k/commits/master]
                    which is a pure port to Python3 without backwards
                    compatibility)
*** New ThirdParty-Libraries
    - six :: Library that helps supporting Python 2 and Python 3 in
             the same source code. Currently version 1.2 from
             [https://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six] is used
    - pyratemp :: Templating library to support the new templating
                  format. Version 0.2.0 from
                  [http://www.simple-is-better.org/template/pyratemp.html]
                  is used
*** Porting to =Windows=
    Port to allow running PyFoam on Windows was done by Bruno Santos
    of blueCAPE (bruno.santos@bluecape.com.pt)

    Patch was originally posted at
    http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/view.php?id=166

    *Note*: many of PyFoam's features are not yet fully functional on
    Windows.
*** Experimental port to =pypy=
    Sources are executed in =pypy= but it seems there are problems
    with =numpy= and also with code like =for l in open(f).readlines()=
** Third-Party
*** Upgraded =ply= to 3.4
    This brings virtually no changes. =README= with copyright
    information has been added
** Infrastructure
*** Parameters can't be modified in =CTestRun= after initialization
    This should help to avoid side-effects
*** Treat timeouts in the =MetaServer= right
    Due to a previous workaround timeouts when collecting information
    about new machines was not treated correctly
*** Add =execute=-method to =ClusterJob=
    This allows the execution of a shell-script in the directory of
    the case
*** Add possibility to run specific modules before or after the solver
    These modules are found in =PyFoam.Infrastructure.RunHooks=. Two
    concrete implementations:
    - =PrintMessageHook= :: to print a text to the terminal
    - =SendToWebservice= :: encode an URL and send it to a webservice
         (example for =pushover.net= added)
    Hooks are automatically instantiated from the configuration data
    (examples are hardcoded))
*** Parameters added to the info about the run
    The Runner-classes now have a parameter =parameters=. This data
    (usually it would be a dictionary) is added verbatim to the run
    info.

    Most runner applications now have the possibility to add this
    info.

    Purpose of this facility is to identify different runs in the
    database better.
*** Parameter handling in =ClusterJob= extended
    Parameter values are now handed to the actual job. Also a
    dictionary with parameters can be handed to the constructor and
    will be used in the relevant callbacks
*** Run data written alongside =PickledPlots=
    During the run whenever the =PickledPlots=-file is written a file
    =pickledUnfinishedData= gets written. This has the current solver
    data and is similar to =pickledData=.

    Also a file =pickledStartData= gets written that has the data that
    is available at the start of the run.
*** =BasicRunner= collects error and warning texts
    The runner collects
    - at every warning the next 20 lines of the output until a total
      of 500 lines is reached (this avoids filling disk and memory if
      the solver produces too many warnings)
    - All output from an error message until the end
    And stores them in the application data
** Library
*** =TemplateFile= now uses =pyratemp=
    The class =TempalteFile= now uses an enhanced templating
    engine. The  old implementation is in the class
    =TemplateFileOldFormat=
*** Clearer error message in Application-classes
    If used as classes (not as utilities) these classes print the
    class name instead of the calling utilities name
*** Output is only colored if it goes to the terminal
    Error and warning messages don't decorate the output if it goes to
    files or other non-terminal streams
*** =error=-method of application classes now raises an exception
    An exception is now raised by =self.error()=. This makes it easier
    to handle such errors if the application class is used. The
    exception is passed up until there is a "real" application
*** =ParsedParameterFile= now knows how to handle binary files
    When the format of a file is =binary= lists with a length prefix
    are being read as binary blobs.

    For reading the blobs a simple heuristics is used: a multiple of
    the length in bytes is read. If the next character is a =)= and
    the characters after that are a certain combination of characters
    (newlines and =;=) then it is assumed that the blob has
    ended. This may fail on certain occasions:
    - if the combination of characters appears at these places
    - if the objects inside the binary data are of different sizes
    It would be hard to work around these restrictions without
    reprogramming the full functionality of OpenFOAM
*** =LabledReSTTable= for more flexible table generation
    New class in the =RestructuredTextHelper= allows more flexible
    generation of tables. Items are added with =column= and =row= and
    if these don't exist in the first row/column the table is extended
    appropriately
*** Plotting classes now allow setting of =xlabel=
    This is implemented for =Gnuplot= and =Matplotlib=. Default for
    the label on the x-Axis is now "Time [s]"
** Utilities
*** =pyFoamFromTemplate.py= with new templating engine
    The utility can now use the pyratemp-templating engine which
    allows templates with loops, conditions and other  fancy stuff
*** =pyFoamSamplePlot.py= allows using the reference data as basis for comparison
    Instead of using the x-values from the original data the y-values
    of the reference data can be used for comparing (with the
    =--use-reference=-option)

    Same for =pyFoamTimelimePlot.py=
*** Scaling and offsets are now used in plots of =pyFoamSamplePlot.py=
    If scales not equal to $1$ and offsets not equal to $0$ are
    specified they are used in the =gnuplot=-output
*** =pyFoamPrintData2DStatistics.py= prints relative average error
    With the =--relative-average-error=-option
*** Enhancements to =pyFoamVersion.py=
    - More tolerant if no library was found
    - Reports the location of the PyFoam-Library
    - Checks whether utility version is consistent the library found
*** =pyFoamRunner.py= allows hooks
    Hooks can be added at the start and the end of a run
*** =pyFoamRedoPlots.py= supports range for plots
    Added =-end= and =-start=-option to select a range that should be
    plotted.

    Currently not working with the Matplotlib-implementation (only gnuplot)
*** =pyFoamDisplayBlockMesh.py= no supports templates
    If a file with values is specified then the utility assumes you're
    editing a template file and will evaluate it before displaying it
*** =pyFoamCaseReport.py= is tolerant towards binary files
    New switch that makes the parser treat files that are declared
    =binary= in the header as if they were =ascii=
*** =pyFoamSamplePlot.py= and =pyFoamTimelinePlot.py= raise error if no plots are generated
    This makes it easier to catch faulty specifications (or empty
    timeline-files)
*** =pyFoamSurfacePlot.py= can wait for a key
    An option =--wait= has been added that makes the utility wait
    before displaying the next picture
*** =pyFoamEchoDictionary.py= is more flexible with binary files
    Switch allows forcing it to read a binary File as an ASCII
*** All utilities now have a switch that starts the debugger even with syntax-errors
    Previously the option =--interactive-debug= only started the
    debugger if the error was *no* syntax error. This is still the
    default behavior, but can be overruled
*** Utilities now can be killed with =USR1= and will give a traceback
    The option =--catch-USR1-signal= now installs a signal-handler
    that prints a traceback and finishes the run. If the interactive
    debugger is enabled then it goes to the debugger-shell.

    Option =--keyboard-interrupt-trace= triggers the same behaviour
    for keyboard interrupts with =<Ctrl>-C=
*** Switch to switch on *all* debug options
    For the purpose of developing a switch =--i-am-a-developer= has
    been added.
*** Plotting utilities now allow specification of x-Axis label
    With the option =xlabel= in the =customRegexp=-file the label on
    the x-axis of the plot can be changed. Setting =ylabel= and
    =y2label= (for the secondary axis) was already possible
*** Metrics and compare for =pyFoamTimelinePlot.py= and =pyFoamSamplePlot.py= support time ranges
    Now the options =--min-time= and =--max-time= are supported by
    =--metrics= and =--compare=
*** =pyFoamDisplayBlockMesh.py= allows graphical selection of blocks and patches
    New addition by Marc Immer allows the graphical selection of
    blocks and patches and adds them to the =blockMeshDict=
*** =pyFoamCloneCase.py= and =pyFoamPackCase.py= accept additional parameters
    The file =LocalConfigPyFoam= is read by these utilities and if
    there is a parameter =addItem= in the section =Cloning= defined
    then these files are cloned/packed automatically (no user
    specification required)
*** =pyFoamListCases.py= now calculates estimated end-times
    Additional option to print the estimated end times. These can be
    wrong if the case did not start from the =startTime= in the
    =controlDict=.

    Also now allows printing the end and the start-time according to
    the =controlDict=
** New features
*** Different "phases" for multi-region solvers
    Plots of type =phase= in =customRegexp= don't actually plot
    anything. The set a phase-name that is used for subsequent values
    (for instance to distinguish the different residuals)
*** =pyFoamChangeBoundaryType.py= allows selection of region and time
    Options =--region= and =--time-directory= added that allow
    selecting different =boundary=-files
*** New class for storing case data in a sqlite-database and associated utilities
    The class =RunDatabase= stores the data from runs. Utility
    =pyFoamAddCaseDataToDatabase.py= is one way to populate the
    database. =pyFoamDumpRunDatabaseToCSV.py= allows dumping that
    data to a file for further processing (in a spreadsheet for
    instance)

    Database can also be populated using a special post-run hook
** Bugfixes
*** Only binary packages of 1.x were found
    Pattern had to start with 1 (now every digit is possible))
*** Option group /Regular expressions/ was listed twice
    No harm done. But fixed
*** =--clear=-option for =pyFoamDecompose.py= not working
    Reason was that =rmtree= does not allow wildcards. Fixed
*** =pyFoamDisplayBlockmesh.py= not working with variable substitution
    The =DictRedirect= would not convert to float. Fixed. Although it
    might happen again for other data types
*** Option =--function-object-data= of =pyFoamClearCase.py= not working with directories
    The option was only implemented for the list-form of the
    =functions= entry in =controlDict=

    Now fixed to also work with the dictionary-form
*** =nonuniform= of length 0 not correctly printed
    Seems like the length was interpreted as the name of the
    list. Fixed
*** Building of pseudocases with =pyFoamRunner.py= broken
    Only worked if no region was specified (= not at all). Fixed
*** =pyFoamRedoPlot.py= did not correctly honor =--end= and =--start=
    Plots were over the whole data range. This is now fix (also the
    issue that =--end= alone did not work)
*** =WriteParameterFile= does not preserve the order of additions
    Contents was "only" set as a dictionary which does not preserve
    the order in which entries are added. Replaced with a =DictProxy=
*** Wrong number of arguments when using =TimelinePlot= in =positions=-mode
    Problem that was introduced by changes in the =fields=-mode
*** =ClusterJob= uses only =metis= for decomposition
    For OpenFOAM-versions 1.6 and higher the automatic decomposition
    used is now =scotch=
*** =pyFoamSamplePlot.py= and =pyFoamTimelinePlot.py= produced no pictures for regions
    As regions have their own subdirectories the =/= from the
    directory name was inserted into the filename and if the
    subdirectory did not exist =gnuplot= did not create the picture
*** Barplots in =pyFoamTimelinePlot.py= not working if value is a vector
    The base class didn't correctly handle the =(= and =)=. Fixed
*** Mysterious deadlocks while plotting long logfiles
    The problem was that during splitting the timeline data an exception was
    raised. This exception was caught by another part of PyFoam. This
    left a lock on the data structure locked and the next access to
    the structure was held indefinitely. Fixed
*** Scanning linear expressions form the block coupled solver failed
    As there is a tuple of residuals the scanner did not analyze the
    output of the output of the block-coupled solver from =1.6-ext=
    correctly. This is now treated as a special case and each residual
    is plotted separately (distinguished by a =[x]= with =x= being the
    number of the component)
*** =#include= not correctly working with macros in the included file
    Macros =$var= were not correctly expanded. Fixed
*** Macros not correctly expanded to strings
    When being expanded to string form macros were not correctly
    expanded
*** =pyFoamPackCase.py= in the working directory produces 'invisible' tar
    If the utility was used in the form
: pyFoamPackCase.py .
    then an 'invisible' tar =..tgz= was produced. Fixed
*** String at the end of a linear solver output makes parsing fail
    Reported in
    [http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-solving/112278-pyfoam-struggles-adopted-solver-post403990.html]
    the string is assumed to be part of the iteration number. Fixed
*** Paraview utilities not working with higher Paraview versions
    At least for PV 3.14 and 3.98 the way the version number is
    determined has changed and the PV-utilities failed. This has been
    fixed but is untested with old versions
*** Camera settings not honored with =pyFoamPVSnapshot.py=
    For the first rendered view Paraview automatically resets the
    camera. This has now been switched off (so the snapshot is
    rendered correctly)
